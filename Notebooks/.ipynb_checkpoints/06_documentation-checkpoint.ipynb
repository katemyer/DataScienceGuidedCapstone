    "**Problem Statement:**\n",
    "To refresh our problem statement, Big Mountain Resort desires to optimize its ticket pricing strategy to maximize revenue \n",
    "and maintain customer satisfaction. By leveraging historical data and modeling techniques, we were able to gain valuable insights \n",
    "into the factors influencing ticket prices and make data-driven recommendations. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Other cost information that would be useful:**\n",
    "- Limited Pricing Data: The dataset primarily focused on ticket prices, neglecting other revenue streams such as rentals, food \n",
    "and beverage, and merchandise. A broader understanding of the resort's revenue mix would provide a more accurate picture of its profitability.\n",
    "- Operational Cost Data: Detailed information on operational costs, including labor, maintenance, utilities, and marketing expenses,\n",
    "- would enable a more precise assessment of the impact of various scenarios on profitability.\n",
    "- Customer-Level Data: Data on individual customer behavior, preferences, and spending habits would provide valuable insights into\n",
    "  pricing strategies and targeted marketing campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Suggest model price and implications with executives**\n",
    "This discrepancy could be attributed to several factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model Assumptions: The model may not have fully captured the complexities of the ski resort market, including competitive pressures, consumer behavior, and economic factors.\n",
    "- Data Quality and Quantity: The quality and quantity of the data used to train the model can significantly impact its accuracy and predictive power.\n",
    "- Operational Constraints: The resort may have operational constraints that limit its ability to increase prices, such as capacity constraints or labor shortages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The business leadership might be surprised by the model's suggested price increase, as it may not align with their current understanding of the market. To validate the model's findings, it's crucial to conduct a thorough analysis of the underlying assumptions and to consult with industry experts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using the model from a business standpoint**\n",
    "We could implement the following for business usage if we decide to move foward with the model:\n",
    "- User-Friendly Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface that allows users to input different scenarios and view the predicted outcomes without requiring deep technical knowledge.\n",
    "- Automated Reports: Create automated reports that summarize the results of various scenarios and provide actionable insights.\n",
    "- Training and Support: Provide training and support to business analysts to ensure they can effectively use the model and interpret its results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalability of current model to consider different features in a future scenario**\n",
    "Since we have spent time on our models, we do want them to be able to scale for future use and prevent from having to redo the entire analysis again. Some aspects to consider for such scalability that would save the business money are the following:\n",
    "- Continuous Model Improvement: Regularly update the model with new data and refine its algorithms to improve its accuracy and predictive power.\n",
    "- Scenario Testing and Pilot Programs: Implement pilot programs to test the feasibility and impact of different pricing strategies and operational changes.\n",
    "- Collaboration with Experts: Engage with industry experts and domain knowledge to refine the model's assumptions and validate its results."
